## SOME NEW CLASSICS

### About

Countless lists of “100 Classics to Read” (or similar) exist for those works which have been defined as [“capital L” Literature](http://www.electricka.com/etaf/muses/literature/literature_popups/whats_literature.htm), works that stand the test of time. When one thinks about reading “the classics” as it pertains to literature, certain books and authors come to mind, many of which are books from white, romance language speaking, and/or eurocentric voices. How can the link between “what is good literature” and the current inclination toward white and eurocentric storytelling be addressed so it can take up less oxygen in the room and make space for broader and more varied voices?  

“Some New Classics” takes a close look at the NYRB Classics - an imprint specializing in “[reissuing volumes that have fallen out of print or been otherwise neglected](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/style/new-york-review-books-classics.html).” This project seeks to understand the cultural makeup of this collection, and whether or not it is a collection that, by its existence, disrupts and decentralizes the current cultural and geographic homogeneity of “the classics.” Through primarily the use of python, this project seeks to retrieve, organize, and disseminate information about the NYRB Classics in the three following categories: original language of the work, country of birth of the author, and “home” country of the author. A distinction is made between the country of birth and home country because it is not uncommon for an author to be born in one country, but more closely self-identify with an alternate country. To accomplish this we will scrape the NYRB Classics list from their website to compile our initial dataset and then use Wikidata to expand upon it. Moving beyond these three main pieces of information, the project may also look into how widely works from the NYRB Classics are disseminated in libraries internationally using the OCLC API.
